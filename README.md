# Boyo Boyo

A Tetris-style game inspired by Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine/Puyo Puyo. This was made for the Indie Game Dev Beginners #002 game jam.

I didn't have much time to complete it as I was busy the first three days of the jam, but I'm still happy with how it came out. Maybe I'll add more features later.

Special thanks to Matt Guptill for the music! https://linktr.ee/Fire.in.the.Woods
